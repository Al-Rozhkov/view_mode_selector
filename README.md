View mode selector
======================

View Mode Selector creates a new field type called *View mode selector* which
will override the view mode of an entity.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

- This module provides a new field type "View mode selector", so just go to "Manage fields" and create a field of that type and choose between a "select list" and a "radio buttons" widget. When you choose "radio buttons" it is possible to upload an icon which will be displayed instead of the view mode name.

- In order to display your referenced entities with the new "View mode selector" view mode don't forget to change the view mode on "Manage display" which is used for displaying them.
